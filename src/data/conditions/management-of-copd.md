# Acute Exacerbation of COPD

## Management

### Treat hypoxia

- AECOPD responds well to moderate oxygen therapy
- Target 88-92% oxygen saturation (9 kPa or 60 mmHg)
- Sufficient oxygen takes priority over hypercapnia

### Prevent severe respiratory acidosis

- Hypercapnia generally tolerated in COPD
- Determine acute respiratory failure by respiratory acidosis rather than hypercapnia
  - If pH < 7.35, consider non-invasive ventilation
  - If pH < 7.25, consider invasive ventilation

### Treat expiratory obstruction

#### Bronchodilation

- Inhaled beta-2 agonists
- Inhaled anticholinergics
- Theophylline not recommended

### Support fatigued respiratory muscles

### Treat underlying cause of exacerbation

### Prevent complications
