# Acute exacerbation of asthma

## Assessment of severity

|                   | Severe - refer to ICU             | Life-threatening - immediate ICU |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Dyspnea           | At rest                           | Exhaustion                       |
| Speech            | Words only                        | Unable to speak                  |
| Respiratory rate  | >25/min                           | Variable/slow                    |
| Accessory muscles | Yes                               | Fatigued                         |
| Wheeze            | Loud                              | Silent                           |
| Heart rate        | >110/min                          | >160/min or bradycardia          |
| Mental status     | Agitated/alert                    | Confused/drowsy                  |
| Oxygen saturation | <94% on FiO2 0.4                  | <90% on 15L/min O2               |
| PaO2              | <9 kPa on FiO2 0.4                | <9 kPa on 15L/min O2             |
| PaCO2             | Normal or low                     | >6 kPa                           |
| Peak flow rate    | <100 L/min or 33-50% of predicted | <60 L/min or <33% of predicted   |

`TODO: add peak flow rate calculator`

## Management

### Treat hypoxia

- Asthma responds well to oxygen therapy
  - Usually with low flow devices
- Target 94-98% oxygen saturation

### Support fatigued respiratory muscles

- Refer to ICU if mechanical ventilation required

### Treat expiratory obstruction

- [Bronchodilators](../drugs/bronchodilators)
- [Corticosteroids](../drugs/corticosteroids)
- [Magnesium sulphate](../drugs/magnesium-sulphate)

### Remove trigger of the exacerbation

- Most likely trigger is viral infection
- Antibiotics only if bacterial infection suspected
- Allergen avoidance

### Prevent complications

- Sputum management controversial although mucus plug and atelectasis is common in severe asthma
- Avoid aggressive physiotherapy
- rule out tension pneumothorax in acute deterioration
