# Fluids

## Types of fluids

### Water

- Usually 5% dextrose
  - Free water causes hemolysis
  - Glucose metabolized rapidly, leaving free water

### Crystalloid

- Mainly expands extracellular fluid volume
  - Contains no protein to retain fluid in intravascular space
  - Similar sodium content as ECF, no net flow into cells
- 0.9% normal saline
- Balanced crystalloids
  - Lactated Ringer's solution
  - Plasma-Lyte A
  - **Contraindicated in hyperkalemia and brain injury**

### Colloid

- Mainly expands intravascular volume
  - Contains protein to exert oncotic pressure
  - Proteins are metabolized at varying rates, redistributing fluid to ECF

## Fluid replacement

| Nutrient  | Daily requirement |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Water     | 30-40 ml/kg       |
| Sodium    | 1-2 mmol/kg       |
| Potassium | 1 mmol/kg         |
| Calcium   | 0.1-0.2 mmol/kg   |
| Magnesium | 0.1-0.3 mmol/kg   |
| Phosphate | 0.4 mmol/kg       |

- Replace fluid in the compartment where it is lost
  - But replace intravascular fluid first in shock
- Colloids expand intravascular volume more
  - But colloids are more expensive and have side effects
  - Use isotonic crystalloids in resuscitation

## Specific indications

### Cardiogenic shock

- 100 ml crystalloid bolus

> Avoid fluids in pulmonary edema

### Hypovolemic shock

- Small volume blood loss (<1 L)
  - Colloid replacement 1-1.5 times the volume lost
    - 5% albumin
    - Gelatin
    - Hetastarch
    - **Side effects** - renal dysfunction, coagulopathy
  - Crystalloid replacement 1.5-2 times the volume lost
    - Lactated Ringer's solution
    - Plasma-Lyte A
- Large volume blood loss
  - Consider blood transfusion

### Septic shock

- 1000 ml crystalloid over 30 minutes
  - Assess response with mental state and urine output
  - **Disregard fluid in-out balance in the first 24 hours**
