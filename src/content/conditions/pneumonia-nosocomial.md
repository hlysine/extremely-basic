# Nosocomial pneumonia

## Definition

- Pneumonia occurring 48 hours or more after hospital admission
- Pneumonia in patient who was discharged from hospital within the last 2 weeks

Refer to [Community-acquired pneumonia](../conditions/pneumonia-community-acquired#investigations)

- Assess risk of multi-drug resistance, hence need for broad-spectrum antibiotics
