# Sepsis

## Management

### Early recognition

- Consider sepsis in all patients with acute organ dysfunction / altered mental status
- Signs of systemic inflammation may not be present
  - Consider occult sepsis in organ dysfunction or high lactate

### Early resuscitation

- Adequate oxygen saturation
- Adequate tissue perfusion
  - High volume fluid resuscitation - [1000 ml crystalloid over 30 minutes](../treatments/fluids#septic-shock)
    - Assess response with mental state and urine output
    - **Disregard fluid in-out balance in the first 24 hours**
  - [Vasopressors](../treatments/vasopressors#norepinephrine) if hypotensive despite fluids
    - Prefer norepinephrine, otherwise epinephrine or dopamine
    - Target MAP 65 mmHg
  - [Dobutamine](../treatments/vasopressors#dobutamine) if low perfusion despite adequate MAP

### Early antibiotics

- Start antibiotics within 1 hour of sepsis recognition
- 2 sets of blood cultures before antibiotics if possible
  - Start antibiotics before cultures if delay is expected
  - Additional culture in 24 hours
- Urine dipstick and culture
- Sputum culture
- Chest X-ray

### Early source control

- Drain abscess
- Debride necrotic tissue
- Remove infected devices
