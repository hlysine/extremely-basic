# Airway management

## Recovery position

![Recovery position](https://0xygaj8b07.ufs.sh/f/USMw46GisEiDKdR3eY11SprnfZbWKaDy3qYzgRwQBT2hteiE)

## Airway maneuvers

### Head tilt-chin lift

- Lift the chin forward
- Tilt the head back

### Triple maneuver

- Tilt the head back
- Displace the ramus of the mandible forward and upward
- Open the mouth

### Modified jaw thrust

- Displace the mandible forward and upward
- Avoid head tilt due to potential C-spine injury

### Oro-pharyngeal airway / Nasopharyngeal airway

- Prefer nasopharyngeal airway in semi-conscious patients

### Bag valve mask

- E-C clamp technique
- Two-person technique if excessive air leakage
- Compress 1/4 of the bag to avoid over-distension of the lungs
  - Tidal volume of 300-500 ml
- Apply cricoid pressure in emergencies to prevent aspiration
  - Insert nasogastric tube after airway is secured
- Allow spontaneous breathing if respiratory effort is adequate

### Endotracheal intubation

- Indicated for
  - Acute upper airway obstruction
  - Facilitation of tracheal suctioning
  - Protection of airway from aspiration
  - Mechanical ventilation
- Not a priority to intubate in cardiac arrest patients when bag valve mask ventilation is effective

## Airway obstruction maneuvers

- Alternate between 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)
