# Hemodynamic monitoring

## Tissue perfusion

- Conscious level
- Skin appearance
  - Capillary refill time
  - Temperature
  - Mottling
- Urine output
  - Normally 0.5-1 ml/kg/hr
- Arterial pH
- Lactate

## Blood pressure

- BP cuff
  - Tends to overestimate in hypotension and underestimate in hypertension
  - Less accurate in arrhythmia

## Passive leg raise

- Similar to a 500 ml fluid challenge
- Rise in pulse pressure by 10% suggests fluid responsiveness
